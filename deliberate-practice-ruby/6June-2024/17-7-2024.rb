# 6. Convert an array of strings into a hash with keys for each string in the array and values for the number of times the string appears in the array.
# For example, ["do", "or", "do", "not"] becomes {"do" => 2, "or" => 1, "not" => 1}.

# 7. Convert a hash into a flat array containing all the hash’s keys and values.

# 8. Combine data from a hash with names and prices and an array of hashes with names, colors, and weights to make a new hash.
# For example, {"chair" => 75, "book" => 15} and [{name: "chair", color: "red", weight: 10}, {name: "book", color: "black", weight: 1}] becomes {"chair" => {price: 75, color: "red", weight: 10}, "book" => {price: 15, color: "black", weight: 1}}.
