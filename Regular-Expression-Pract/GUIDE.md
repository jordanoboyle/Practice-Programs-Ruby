Here I will be covering regular expressions and practice with them.
This is meant as a guide for myself and a reference that I can look at
at a later date for a better understanding on my part.

That said, if there is ever anyone who wants to use the notes here, please
do so at your leisure. Most of the files will have a lot of comments and
doc strings so I have something to reference in the future. 

While this maybe be a bunch of turtle vomit to most with an experience,
hopefully it can provide some help to someone new just like the act of practicing
did the same for me. Turtle POWER!

Below are credits to gems used when needed to create data sets or 
data that I can interact with through practice:

Faker gem
Geocoder gem
