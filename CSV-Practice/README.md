Here we are building various different CSV files using the Faker gem. 
Faker is designed to generate fake data such as names, addresses,
phone numbers, and even a pokedex if so desired. 
Access to Faker provided below:

I will be developing this within the CSV-Practice directory. 
It is meant for my own personal use to get better, however anyone who
happens upon this repository is welcome to use any of the basic databases 
I make for their own purposes. Yes, they will be silly most of the time,
but they will also be made with the purpose of getting better at using 
CSVs. 

Will update if I start using some of these databases in working programs.
